# Data-Visualization

Hello There!

Thank you for taking a look at my Data Visualization Project with UCI's Data Analysis BootCamp! Everything that you will need to review is in the Pymaceuticals, Inc folder, the notebook with the main code to grade is in that folder, and the CSV's are in the Data subfolder. I did take a few liberties in the naming conventions of this assignment since it is a bit of a darker subject, so hopfully my names make you giggle a little bit! 

Let's jump into it! 
With this project I am cosplaying as a senior data anlyst with a new pharaceutical company, Pymaceuticals, inc, specializing in anti-cancer Medications. We wanted to begin screening potential treatements for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occuring form of skin cancer. 
We are conducting our analysis on 249 mice who were identified to have SCC and received treatment of different drug regimens over 45 days.

All analysis projects start with the ETL fundamentals so I extracted the dataset, transformed it by cleaning and removing duplicates, and loaded it into a Pandas Dataframe to get summary stats on drug regimen, mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error on the tumor sizes. Then generated bar charts, pie charts, quartiles, outliers, boxplots, line, scatter plots, and correlation regression with Pandas and PyPlot.

Here is my final anlysis:
Within the study of tumor shrinking regimens, this trail concludes that Capomulin was the most success at reducing the tumors assocaiated with squamous cell carcinoma. The second most performative drug was Ramicane. In a specific subject, mouse m957, had a 46 mm3 tumor on day 10 of treatment, but shrunk the tumor down to 32.5 mm3 by day 35. While the tumor size rebound by around 1.5 mm3 by the trail end, longer studies of this medication should be pursued. Capomulin has shown to be affective towards both male and female mice, and mice of all weight and tumor sizes.

Thank you!
