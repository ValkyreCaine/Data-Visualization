# Data-Visualization

Hello There!

Thank you for taking a look at my Data Visualization Challenge! In this challenge you will fin everything that you need in the Pymaceuticals, Inc folder, the notebook with the main code to grade is in that folder, and the CSV's are in the Data subfolder. I did take a few liberties in the naming conventions of this assignment since it is a bit of a darker subject, so hopfully my names make you giggle a little bit! 

All code was written by me with the help of the class curriculum and the class AI tool for troubshooting. 
Thank you!
